# QRandBarcode

his is not only an application, this is just a supper efficient tool to scan and generate QR or Barcode scanner. It scans perfectly almost every time smoothly. 

I has a simple, straightforward, apparently great user interface to interact with its features. We represented three major feature; Scanner, Generator and Result History with a Bottom Navigator. It has increased usability a lot.

Scanner dynamically detect content type within a single panel without toggling camera view. User will be able to toggle camera flash, autofocus by semitransparent on screen button on the camera view. Also switching camera between front and rear camera is that much easy from the same button group.

The next feature is generating QR and barcode from text. There is an easy toggle button into the input panel to change the type of output. User can save and share generated QR or barcode as an image.

Al the scanned result will be stored into local database for future use. History will be visible into a simple list. User can copy result to clipboard to user somewhere else. App can detect web URL intelligently. If web URL found as a scanned result, it will be redirected to web browser directly.

App has been designed following material design guideline. We have used all native API and components for smoothness and efficiency.
